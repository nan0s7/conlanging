## Solresol
- the [text renderer](https://github.com/nan0s7/conlanging/blob/master/solresol/madelines_renderer.html) created by [Madeline Maple (MegaLoler)](https://github.com/MegaLoler) in [this post on Sidosi](https://www.sidosi.org/community/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=161&p=945&hilit=Renderer#p945) is a fantastic renderer that turns your Solresol text into the official stenography, musical notes and the official colo[u]rs. The online version was lost, but [Wayback Machine made a backup of it in 2016](https://web.archive.org/web/20160203183138/https://19f16305f9d12552d855f158571a31aa70600c4c.googledrive.com/host/0B3_aRegKVpZ2VzlTTWtLODdqVTg/content/solresol/render.html) if you wish to use that while it's still there, or just download it from this repository.
- I have compiled a (probably incomplete) [list of similar languages to Solresol](https://github.com/nan0s7/conlanging/blob/master/solresol/similarLanguages.txt) which includes languages that are either; based off of some form of musical notation, languages that take inspiration from how Solresol works overall and or direct derivatives to Solresol itself.
- I've been working on a [new Dictionary](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/182okssrHseIggjHGlzWyFH81-o8y8EsvQtJfPJYu6r8/edit?usp=sharing) for Solresol, which is based off of the [original one done in large by Garrison Osteen](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-3lBxMURGN4AtGG846kuVGVNuEiHewCT88PiBahnODA/edit#gid=0) and the community. I have formatted the dictionary in a more user-experience focussed layout, and have included extras such as: grammar, accentuation examples and suggested modifications for the future of Solresol. I've been assisted by everyone in the Solresol Discord, but the two greatest helps have been Dan Parson and Slorany.
- I've started keeping a [log of the original French translations](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17xbhdVWLNYktm3-MsFYOgqiLEbQ53V0Uogj2ayEHn7c/edit?usp=sharing) of each word, including the page of Sudre's original document they're found in, as well as any minor edits I've made.
- I've been slowly learning French, and with that knowledge I've been slowly translating the original document on Solresol by Sudre, [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q5qKEEXq4iWaM8KlQdM6wkrKtNoGty_KBucwdIc7zNk/edit?usp=sharing). I've included some comments of the graphics in the document for those reading my translation with a TTS (text-to speech) program.

A brilliant concept, with the transcription technique used to describe the language woven into the history of how this alien bug's language became known to humanity. Definitely check this one out. The web page is even well-designed. [Terry Donnelly]" from the [experimental conlang directory](http://quetzal.bogarthome.net/conlang/exper.html)

Last I checked this page had an extensive vocabulary and some morphology information. [Bruce Koestner]", (same link as above). Uses a 12-part categorisation system; a mix of Solresol and Ro.
