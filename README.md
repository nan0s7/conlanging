## Solresol
- the [text renderer](https://github.com/nan0s7/conlanging/blob/master/solresol/solresol_renderer_online.zip) created by [Madeline Maple (megaloler9000)](https://www.sidosi.org/community/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=161&p=945&hilit=Renderer#p945) is a fantastic renderer that turns your Solresol text into the official stenography, musical notes and the official colo[u]rs.
