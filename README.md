## Solresol
- the [text renderer](https://github.com/nan0s7/conlanging/blob/master/solresol/madelines_renderer.html) created by [Madeline Maple (megaloler9000)](https://www.sidosi.org/community/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=161&p=945&hilit=Renderer#p945) is a fantastic renderer that turns your Solresol text into the official stenography, musical notes and the official colo[u]rs. The online version was lost, but [Wayback Machine made a backup of it in 2016](https://web.archive.org/web/20160203183138/https://19f16305f9d12552d855f158571a31aa70600c4c.googledrive.com/host/0B3_aRegKVpZ2VzlTTWtLODdqVTg/content/solresol/render.html) if you wish to use that while it's still there.
